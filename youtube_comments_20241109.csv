@abhishekojha3802,Don't agree with the return data you all are showing... I have been an investor since last 10 months..

@supriyomondal8829,"Would love to see

1.  portfolios suitable for 10-30 L Investors . methodology can be same but number of stock may change and want better slippage tracking.
2. Swing trading / regular profit booking portfolio. maybe positional 
3. Maybe opportunity stocks buy . Some now or never deal . Basically want regular profit booking. 
4. Some option / future hedging focused . 
5. Anything that average people can not do and easy to implement through one click of small case. 
6. Lastly if possible launch some alternative to small case. They do not listen to customer feedbacks and lery slow in implementing the features. I personally have suggested many things to them but does not seem like they are listening.

@sudhsrk1,"Sir, I have subscribed to Gulaq 6. I have one concern, that some of these stocks are PSU sector and PSU bank stocks and some of the stocks are not fundamentally good and may be growing only based on momentum. History says that these are not growth oriented over a long run. If there is crash in these stocks due to news or otherwise, how will you handle a scenario like that as the rebalance happens at every 1 month. If they were pure growth stocks there is a chance of recovery in them even if they fall. Will you be booking loss in them at the end of 1 month if they don't recover or how can we protect the drawdown. I am scared about F&O PSU stocks that could fall 50% in a single day. If 2 to 3 such stocks fall in the same month it can wipe out 20 to 30% of the portfolio.",1,2024-02-08 12:16:27+00:00,kCw02_bhUIs,Gulaq February AMA Webinar,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCw02_bhUIs

@keerthi4513,"What these people do not talk about is the ""cost"". In the long term the costs eat away 15-20% of your Porfolio's CAGR. For instance, in the long-term if the portfolio's CAGR is 40%, your net CAGR will be only 20% after incorporating the costs. You can see this exemplified under ""Cost-adjusted Returns"" on your Smallcase dashboard. The keywords here are ""in the long term"".

What are the costs? Every smallcase SIP is charged. Every smallcase lumpsum investment is charged. You pay for the subscription. You pay hefty DP charges when you sell the stocks (at the time of Rebalancing). You pay STT, brokerage, Exchange charges, SEBI charges, Stamp Duty, GST (at the time of Rebalancing or SIP or lumpsum investment). These are nowhere shown or accounted in the portfolio. Just remember the costs will eat away 15-20% off your CAGR. Enjoy!",0,2024-02-07 10:44:37+00:00,mEwqtQd80X4,Ask Me Anything with Gulaq Experts,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEwqtQd80X4

@supriyomondal8829,"Please please please ask the smallcase team to introduce the overlapping percentage accross different smallcases. Asking them since last 3 years. No idea why it‚Äôs not introduced yet. 


Presently there‚Äôs so much overlapping between mi20 and gulaq gear 6 stocks. However I still can see one positive side is that if I carry the same stocks in gulaq for more than 1 year (which can be true in many cases ) there‚Äôs a chance of saving some money though LTCG. But in general before subscribing more than one smallcase i feel the overlapping is important. 


I come from a product and market research background and extensively worked with leading mobile brands. However it makes me believe that smallcase isn‚Äôt taking the customer feedback‚Äôs seriously .

@sandip121279,"46:48 You mentioned SEBI doesn‚Äôt allow more than 6 months subscription plan, but there are many smallcases which are offering 1 year subscription plan. 
My reasoning to go for yearly subscription is better deal (discounts) but more about having 1 year commitment when one is subscribed. Otherwise investor may look for returns every 6 months if this is good smallcase or move to some other smallcase. This shall not be a trigger but It‚Äôs all about human psychology. I myself moved in past accross smallcases during subscription renewal when returns were not good. This becomes then trigger and act as frequent distraction.
