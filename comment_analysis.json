The mention of a \"Google form\" indicates that the discussion might be related to feedback or queries submitted through a structured format.\n\n2. **Sentiment:**\n   - The sentiment of the comment seems neutral. The commenter is stating a fact about having already submitted a query, without expressing any positive or negative emotions.\n\n3. **Common Issues:**\n   - The comment hints at a potential issue with communication or response time. The fact that the commenter felt the need to mention they had already raised the query suggests they might be waiting for a response or resolution.\n\n4. **Notable Feedback:**\n   - There is no direct feedback or suggestion in the comment. However, implicitly, it suggests that the process of handling queries (possibly through Google forms) could be improved, especially in terms of response efficiency.\n\n5. **Community Engagement:**\n   - With only one comment provided, it's difficult to assess the level of community engagement.
